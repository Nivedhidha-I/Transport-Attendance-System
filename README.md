# Automated Transport Attendance System (BSc Project)

## Project Summary

This repository contains the full source code and documentation for a functional Automated Transport Attendance System. This system was designed to replace manual, paper-based tracking of student/employee ridership on dedicated transport vehicles. The solution can be used with mobile or RFID technology for fast, accurate check-in/check-out, combined with a centralized database and web interface for real-time monitoring and reporting.

## System Architecture & Technical Focus 

This project highlights expertise in modern data management and application development:

* Eliminated manual errors and provided instant, timestamped attendance records, crucial for safety and compliance reporting.

* Developed a structured relational database schema capable of handling high transaction volumes (check-in/out logs) and maintaining driver, route, and passenger details.
